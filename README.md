## Sudoku

This puzzle commonly appears in print media and online. You are presented with an n × n grid with some symbols, for example digits or letters, filled in. The symbols must be from a set of n symbols. The goal is to fill in the remaining symbols in such a way that each row, column, and subsquare, contains each symbol exactly once. In order for all of that to make sense, n must be a square integer such as 4, 9, 16, or 25.

## Word Ladder

This puzzle involves transforming one word into a target word by changing one letter at a time. Each word must belong to a specified set of valid words. Here’s an example where we assume that the set of valid words is a rather large set of common English words, and the goal is to get from the word ‘cost’ to the word ‘save’:

cost → cast → case → cave → save
